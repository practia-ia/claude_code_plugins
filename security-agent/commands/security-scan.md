# Security Scan

Invoke the security-review agent to perform a comprehensive security audit.

## Instructions

You are being asked to perform a security scan. Use the security-review agent to conduct a thorough security audit of the codebase.

Simply delegate this task to the security-review agent:

```
@security-review perform a comprehensive security audit of this codebase,
prioritizing authentication, authorization, user input handling, and sensitive
data management. Provide a structured report with severity classifications.
```

The agent will analyze the code and provide detailed findings with remediation steps.
